# Walking Into It

This game is an entry for IFComp 2021. http://ifcomp.org

It is written in Python. It should be backwards compatible with 

wii.py (the script) and wii.txt (the data file) need to be in the same directory.

It was originally written as a prospective EctoComp game in 2019, but it got too big for the Petite Mort division (4 hours).

The bigger rewrite was first part of an attempt to understand minimax, then to get much more familiar with classes. So while it's an exercise, I also hope and believe it will be entertaining for the end-player.
