Walking Around It reasoning

You may or may not have guessed it is impossible to achieve a draw in 3x3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe/noughts and crosses. Here is a short proof by contradiction why. We will try to construct a drawn game and fail, e.g. block the most obvious three in a rows with a less obvious one resulting.

For a quick proof, building actual games isn't very constructive, though it might provide a hint. Double threats can pop up quickly! The key is to find some simple cases where filling an empty square wins for either side.

For me it broke open when I considered the corner squares of the top plane. Assume they're all the same. X or O doesn't matter here, though it will later once we consider matches across planes, since we'll assume X is in the center.

X| |X
-+-+-
 | |
-+-+-
X| |X

You may notice that placing an X in any remaining squares means X wins. But placing X nowhere gives O a win! This sort of logic will pop up again.

Also note that if we have alternating X's and O's in each corner, either player wins if they take the center square.

X| |O
-+-+-
 | |
-+-+-
O| |X

Now assume the very central square is an X. We will show 2 X's in adjacent corners are not allowed. Put 2 X's, in the top row of the top level, shown on the left. (If not, the board can be rotated.) Then some placements are forced.

Note the X an O could be flipped horizontally, and it's the same puzzle either way--but we can't have 4 O's on the bottom, and 2 X's would make 4 X's total on the north face of the cube.

X| |X  | |  X| |O
-+-+- -+-+- -+-+-
 | |   |X|   | |
-+-+- -+-+- -+-+-
 | |   | |  O| |O

But now the bottom right square in the top level is an O, or X has a diagonal match across the plane. The other corner is an X, or you have a square of 4 O's on the bottom row.

X| |X  | |  X| |O
-+-+- -+-+- -+-+-
 | |   |X|   | |
-+-+- -+-+- -+-+-
X| |O  | |  O| |O

This gives a contradiction. In the center plane, O's must go in the top left, left and top squares to block 3-in-a-rows. But then both of the bottom left and upper right squares must be X's. But that creates three X's in a row.

Since each face of the cube must 1) have no 2 corner X's adjacent and 2) not have X-O-X-O and 3) not have all O's, we have 3 O's and 1 X in the corner of each face. That gives us this.

O| |O  | |  X| |O
-+-+- -+-+- -+-+-
 | |   |X|   | |
-+-+- -+-+- -+-+-
O| |X  | |  O| |O

But now the center squares in the top and bottom planes can't be O, which creates 3 X's in a row vertically.

So there is no way for a game of three-dimensional three-by-three Tic-Tac-Toe/noughts and crosses to end in a draw.
