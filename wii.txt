##################################macros for what kid says (deprecated/deprecatable?)
MACRO_MATTER~0	"Does it matter? I don't think it does." $KID fidgets. You can't blame them. You miss the luxury of that sort of impatience.
MACRO_FAIR_WIN~-3	"I had you either way! Go, me!"
MACRO_YAWN~-2	"Oh, a draw. Well, that was fast. We can play again." And why not?
MACRO_NO_FAIR~-1	Sadly, $KID doesn't smile.\n\n"No fair! You missed an obvious block. I want to win fair and square! I'm not a baby any more. Geez."\n\n$KID looks hurt, then worried that might've hurt you. You do feel a bit silly. You commend $KID for being observant and mention adults lose their focus, too.
MACRO_BLOCK_AGAIN~0	"Block again. I won't lose THAT easily."
MACRO_OKAY_BLOCK~0	"Guess I have to block here."

##################################quit messages
txtary	quitmsg	$KID looks a bit sad, but at least you tried. You guess.
txtary	quitmsg	$KID seems to understand you have places to go, things to do and people to see. Well, two out of three ain't bad. They seem glad you paid them some attention.
txtary	quitmsg	Walking away, you wonder if it would make the parting less awkward to say "I believe in you, kiddo. You can figure out all the other ways to win!"
txtary	quitmsg	Your head was spinning from the possibilities. And yet, at the same time, you know there are only finitely many, so if $KID will figure things out with enough dedication.
txtary	quitmsg	You were getting a bit sick of losing. Perhaps you were also upset you ran out of ways to lose creatively. But you think you did enough for $KID.
txtary	quitmsg	You convince yourself $KID will figure the last way through, and that will impress their peers. You hope.
txtary	quitmsg	Congratulations on helping $KID feel better, and I hope you enjoyed this!
##################################about-text array
txtary	about	This was originally intended to be a 4-hour EctoComp game in 2019, but the scope was much too big. Plus I thought it was too abstract. Why bother?
txtary	about	But games like Sandcastle Master, from the Text Adventure Literacy Jam at https://itch.io/jam/talp, stuck in my mind. It's a trip to the beach where an adult gives a kid a scavenger hunt to get peace and quiet. So I wondered, what else do adults do for kids that maybe kids realize later?
txtary	about	And some of my favorite memories of being taught are people who helped me feel smarter than them. Looking back, of course, I realize how clever they were to frame things as they did.
txtary	about	Also, as a chess player, I remember my fear of how bore draws might take the game over. Sometimes it felt like "best play" might ruin chess. Tic-tac-toe was obviously all about the draws, too, with "best play..." or was it? I enjoyed the what-if meta-games.
txtary	about	I initially went ahead with this to make sure I kept my IFComp streak alive at 11. My other game had had roadblocks, and I was happy with this once I made it about more than some silly abstract kids' game. Then, of course, I had the idea for another short game.
txtary	about	Along the way, I managed to learn about AI and minimax and that sort of thing, and I originally wrote the game without classes. So I rewrote it with classes and learned a lot. I used Pylint to clean up the code. I set a goal of under 1000 lines in the main program. I even used trivial markdown in wii.txt, for the kid's randomly-generated name and alternate board numberings.
txtary	about	So I think the game stands well on its own, if it's not especially big. Maybe you'll be glad it doesn't drag on, and if you're playing this during IFComp, hopefully that will save your energy to try others. There will probably be a lot of entries.
txtary	about	My email is blurglecruncheon@gmail.com if you want to contact me about bugs, features, or general stuff.
##################################basichelp-text array
txtary	basichelp	Most of the time, you will usually just want to type a number from +0 to +8 inclusive to make a move.
txtary	basichelp	There are meta-commands as well. They are divided into two groups.
txtary	basichelp	I gives general information commands, and T toggles various options.
txtary	basichelp	None of the commands is necessary to win the game, but some may add flavor or ease of play.
##################################option-text array
txtary	options	You don't need to change any of these options to win the game. However, some may make it easier to view and process things.
txtary	options	D cycles the display between X first, O first, you as X, and $KID as X. You can also use D1 to D4.
txtary	options	G toggles the grid display when showing the board.
txtary	options	H or M toggles whether or not the current game history is displayed above the board.
txtary	options	N toggles whether square numbers are shown in the grid or not.
txtary	options	O (one) puts 1 in the upper left. Z (zero) puts 0. (012/123 would be the top row, 678/789 the bottom.) # toggles them, too.
txtary	options	R toggles screen reader mode, though you probably want to keep it fixed.
##################################meta-text array
txtary	meta	Some meta-commands give information about the game state. You don't need them to win, but they can provide clues.
txtary	meta	A is a general ABOUT, and C is CREDITS.
txtary	meta	L or W or S (Losses, Wins, Scores) shows your progress, i.e. $KID's wins.
txtary	meta	Q quits and disappoints $KID, though you need to type it twice, so you don't do so by accident.
txtary	meta	X examines the tic-tac-toe game $KID was playing alone, which may or may not be a useful or spoilery hint.
txtary	meta	V or ? views possible commands.
##################################credits-text array
txtary	credits	Thanks to my testers: A. DiBianca, Andy Joel, Ade McT and Mike Russo. They all took time to look at a fellow IFComp entrant's effort and make it better, and I enjoyed what they had to offer as well.
#txtary	credits	Thanks to people who found bugs and suggested features once the game was released: Autumn Chen and Amanda Walker helped me uncover problems with Python 2.x, Viv Dunstan found a regression introduced by an update, and dgtziea found a useful bug when the endgame cut out too soon.
txtary	credits	Thanks to people on various discord servers for general game talk: PunyInform, Adventuron, and the 6502 workshop. It helped when I was stuck with things.
txtary	credits	I did some research for this. Not a lot, but enough to mention people who've helped me without knowing it.
txtary	credits	Thanks to Clederson Cruz for the tic tac toe minimax code: https://github.com/Cledersonbc/tic-tac-toe-minimax/issues
txtary	credits	Thanks to stackoverflow for helping me with so much cool coding stuff, enough so I would be confident writing a Python text adventure.
txtary	credits	And thanks to everyone who's been even moderately successful with a homebrew IFComp entry. It all gave me the confidence to try a project in something other than Inform or Twine.
##################################introduction text array
txtary	intro	The book on the four-color theorem isn't online, and it's in the research collection at the main library branch, so you'll have to make a trip. That's okay--the weather's been nice. It's a short train ride and walk. Walking past a park just blocks from the library, you see kids playing ball and yelling. But one kid is to the side, staring at a tic-tac-toe game in chalk on the pavement.
txtary	intro	You think back to all the draws you played as a kid. Against other kids. Just glad you never lost. It beat the heck out of more physical activities, where you outright lost. But then the draws got boring. At least you've kept in shape over the years ... though you haven't been in any physical contests for a while. Or wanted to be. Seeing that kid reminds you of something, though.
txtary	intro	It reminds you of the day you finally won a game. Against another kid who missed something. It didn't feel as good as you hoped, and you didn't know why. You wanted to win and feel clever about it, but you never quite did. The wish felt greedy.
txtary	intro	You introduce yourselves and exchange names. $KID looks up at you. "Would you like to play?"
txtary	intro	Why not? You sit down to play with $KID. You have a faint memory, of one kid taunting another that their position was hopeless. The game itself wasn't important... but you wish you could remember...
txtary	intro	You're pretty confident you'll figure it out, though. There can only be so many possible unique games of Tic-Tac-Toe. There's enough space on the sidewalk for as many as you need.
txtary	intro	You think back to what you would've wanted as a kid. You remember how adults let you win at certain games, but it was too obvious, and you were almost mad at them. Or you'd win at a game of luck and they'd say "Oh, you found your game," but you knew the truth.
txtary	intro	Maybe you can put your finger on what you wanted and what $KID wants now. Maybe figuring things out will be a win of sorts for you.
##################################old game text array
txtary	examine	You look at the game $KID was playing. It's only partially finished.
txtary	examine	X| |O\n-+-+-\n |O|\n-+-+-\nX| |X
txtary	examine	You think you see what's going to happen there, and you also think you can see more or less how the position came about.
##################################winhope messages by order
txtary	winning_move_act	"Umm ... I think this wins. I hope."
txtary	winning_move_act	$KID nods slightly, pauses, nods again, and moves.
txtary	winning_move_act	$KID points at a few squares, then moves.
txtary	winning_move_act	$KID makes the big move a little more confidently than last time.
txtary	winning_move_act	$KID shoots their hand forward to move almost immediately.
txtary	winning_move_act	$KID almost knocks your hand away with their move.
##################################win messages by order
txtary	win_progress	$KID can't help making a small show. A few other kids look up from playing ball and stop by. Not NEEDING a break, of course, just curious. They ask $KID to replay the win. $KID obliges.
txtary	win_progress	A few more kids stop by. You don't need to provide a replay this time. The initial crowd is glad to relate what happened.
txtary	win_progress	There are still enough kids for several games in the background. But more are gathering, impressed at this new hero they didn't take much notice of before. You hear a brief argument about whether to cheer $KID on or keep quiet to help them focus.
txtary	win_progress	This time, the crowd cheers a bit after your latest loss. Everyone wonders how much is left. Some still can't believe $KID managed to win so convincingly going second! More kids stop by.
txtary	win_progress	Someone in the crowd whines, "How much more is there going to BE, anyway?" The kids around shush. You assure everyone there's just one more big win. A few kids groan. Others call their friends for the finale, because it might be over soon.
txtary	win_progress	$KID jumps up. You mention, yes, that's the last of the ways to win. Others surround $KID, asking "how'd you do it?" and so forth. A few come up to you and ask if you'd be willing to lose like that again. You gently explain that your friend was in the right place at the right time, but if they are lucky, the tic-tac-toe champ may be kind enough to show how it's done, or maybe let special friends try, in the near future. But not right now! It's just be a memory exercise.\nYour friend is mobbed and invited to the game. You make your way to the library. The book you wanted is a bit dry, and it's also short on detail. You could use, well, a big sidewalk and chalk to look at some of the cases. But you get through it -- taking breaks to look over the park. As everyone leaves, you notice $KID's orange t-shirt in the crowd. It's pretty clear.\n\nYou think back to other games you always wondered about on the way home. That night you learn about Bridge-It or Connect Four. You even brave the intricacies of Nim and, even more dauntingly, Wythoff's Nim.\n\nYou're sure there's more. You're also sure you'd not have thought of them without running into your friend. What else will you think of looking into that you forgot?

##################################win detail messages
winver	first-already-first	But sadly, $KID doesn't look very happy. It didn't feel new, because it wasn't. A win is a win, but that was the same win as before.
winver	first-already-second	But sadly, $KID looks ... polite. Composed. Despite winning without going first. Because it'd already been done.
winver	exact-position-before	You're a bit surprised when $KID proclaims they already won from this exact position, so it really shouldn't count. Impressive insight!
winver	rotation-before	You're a bit surprised when $KID starts mentioning how this win LOOKED sort of like another one, so they're not sure if it should count. You undo the last couple moves and rotate and flip the board in your head, and yeah, you have to agree.
winver	shift-side-to-corner	But you hammer out a bargain. Since you going first in the corner is probably tougher to beat than you going first on the side, and you recall that one game COULD'VE transposed with you starting in the corner, you count it as such. $KID nods, understanding, you think.
winver	shift-one-side-to-win	But wait. $KID managed to win more than one way when you started from the side. You both agree it's okay to say, okay, $KID's now won when you've started in the corner or the side.
##################################win messages by start type
msg-type	1	1	You congratulate $KID on what is probably the toughest way to win. You took the center first, and somehow they pulled it out!
msg-type	1	2	"Wow! I feel good about that. But I guess I had to take the center there eventually to win." You both poke at other possibilities for a bit and realize that if you take a corner first, then they take an adjacent one, and you take the square between, they can win by taking the corner opposite your first move, then the other corner. But then $KID sees the classic tic-tac-toe win where your second move was in the opposite corner.\n\nIf you want notation, that little offhand game went +0-+2-+1-+8-+5-+6.
msg-type	1	3	"Well, you sort of wasted your first move," $KID says. "I mean ... well ... you know. I think. I hope." You do. But they still did well, and you let them know.
msg-type	2	1	$KID shrugs a bit, wondering if they really deserved it. Starting in the center was probably the easiest way to win. But you brush off their concerns and commend them for recognizing that was the easiest way through and wanting more.
msg-type	2	2	$KID fingers the latest game's moves in the order you both played, reliving their latest moment of glory.
msg-type	2	3	$KID seems slightly blown away that they could win by taking the side square first.
